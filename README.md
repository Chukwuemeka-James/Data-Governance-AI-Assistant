# Data Governance AI Assistant

## Research Topic

**Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Real-Time Data Governance**

The **Data Governance AI Assistant** (DataGovBot) is an AI-powered tool designed to provide accurate, real-time insights on data governance policies, regulations, and best practices.
This system integrates **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques to combine authoritative knowledge sources with advanced language models. The result is a robust assistant capable of delivering precise, context-aware answers to complex data governance queries.

## Research Objectives

This research explores how Retrieval-Augmented Generation can be harnessed to:

* Simplify access to comprehensive data governance knowledge.
* Provide real-time, evidence-based responses grounded in authoritative regulatory sources.
* Support businesses, researchers, and policymakers in making informed, compliant, and timely decisions.

## Key Features

* **Real-Time Knowledge Retrieval**: Dynamically fetches and integrates relevant governance information from curated sources.
* **Accurate Q\&A System**: Delivers fact-based answers to user queries with citations from established data governance literature.
* **Interactive Web Interface**: A user-friendly Flask web application enables seamless interaction with the assistant.
* **Model Endpoint Testing**: A dedicated HTML interface allows for rapid prototyping and validation of model responses.

## Methodology and Technologies

This project applies state-of-the-art **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** pipelines alongside a suite of supporting technologies to build the AI assistant:

* **Language Model**: Groq API-powered language model to generate coherent and contextually relevant answers.
* **Vector Database**: Pinecone for embedding-based knowledge retrieval.
* **Document Embedding**: Techniques to transform governance documents into searchable vector representations.
* **Web Framework**: Flask, for serving the interactive interface.
* **Knowledge Base**: Curated corpus of data governance documents, including GDPR, Nigeria Data Protection Act (2025), and other international regulations.

The detailed research methodology, including architecture design, embedding strategies, and evaluation approaches, is documented in the research notebook:
`research/DataGovBot_Research.ipynb`

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Data-Governance-AI-Assistant.git
cd Data-Governance-AI-Assistant
```

2. **Set up the virtual environment and install dependencies**

```bash
pip install pipenv
pipenv install
```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file and specify API keys:

```
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_key
groq_api_key=your_groq_key
```

4. **Run the application**

```bash
pipenv run python app.py
```

The app will be available at `http://0.0.0.0:8080`

## Example Usage

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`
2. Enter a query (e.g.,
   *"What is the role of a joint representative under GDPR?"*)
3. Receive an instant, structured response sourced from authoritative governance documents.

| What is Data Governance?                            | A framework of processes, roles, policies, and standards that ensure effective and secure use of data within an organization.                            |
| What are the core principles of GDPR?               | Lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity, confidentiality, and accountability. |
| What is the Nigeria Data Protection Act (2025)?     | Establishes rules for processing personal data in Nigeria, emphasizing transparency, accountability, and data subject rights.                            |
| How does blockchain enhance data governance?        | By providing immutability, transparency, and auditability of data transactions, supporting verifiable and tamper-resistant governance.                   |
| What is a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)? | A process to assess and mitigate data protection risks, especially when handling sensitive or large-scale personal data.                                 |

More example Q\&As are available within the application interface.
